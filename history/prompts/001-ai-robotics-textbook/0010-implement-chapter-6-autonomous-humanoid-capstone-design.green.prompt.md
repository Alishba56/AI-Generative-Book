  I have completed creating Chapter 6: Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Design and have also created a PHR for it. This marks the completion of all chapters from the initial list.

  The chapter covers:
  -   **Introduction**: Context of humanoid robotics and learning objectives for the capstone design.
  -   **Core Concepts**: Detailed humanoid robot architecture (hardware, software stack), Whole-Body Control (WBC), advanced perception for human environments, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) design, safety and ethical considerations, and integration challenges.
  -   **Practical Examples**: Conceptual capstone design stages, pseudocode illustrating the integration of VLA output to Whole-Body Control, and a conceptual safety monitor node.
  -   **Illustrations/Diagrams**: ASCII diagrams for high-level humanoid software architecture, VLA to WBC workflow, and a safety loop.
  -   **References**: APA-formatted citations to foundational texts, research in WBC and HRI, ethical guidelines, and specific humanoid platforms.
  -   **Summary & Conclusion**: Key takeaways from the chapter and the entire textbook, along with a future outlook for AI and robotics.
